P2P Noise library aims to serve as a tool to create secure P2P networks based on the Noise Framework.

* Quick creation of custom P2P networks
* Small and easy to use
* Simplistic and Lightweight

## Features

> [Noise Secure Handshake](http://www.noiseprotocol.org/):
Noise is a framework for building crypto protocols. Noise protocols support mutual and optional authentication, identity hiding, forward secrecy, zero round-trip encryption, and other advanced features.

> [Adaptive Lookup for Unstructured Peer-to-Peer Overlays](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1509.04417.pdf):
The global search comes at the expense of local
interactions between peers. Most of the unstructured peer-topeer overlays do not provide any performance guarantee. In this
work we propose a novel Quality of Service enabled lookup for
unstructured peer-to-peer overlays that will allow the userâ€™s
query to traverse only those overlay links which satisfy the given
constraints

## Install

```
go get github.com/geolffreym/p2p-noise
```

## Basic usage

```
package main

import (
	"context"
	"log"

	noise "github.com/geolffreym/p2p-noise"
)

func main() {
	node := noise.NewNode()
	// Network events channel
	ctx, cancel := context.WithCancel(context.Background())
	events := node.Events(ctx)

	go func() {
		for msg := range events {
			// Here could be handled events
			if msg.Type() == noise.SelfListening {
				log.Printf("Listening on: %s \n", msg.Payload())
				cancel() // stop listening for events
			}
		}
	}()

	// ... some code here
	// node.Dial("192.168.1.1:4008")
	// node.Close()

	// ... more code here
	node.Listen("127.0.0.1:4008")

}

```
